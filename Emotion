Six basic emotion states that are universal for all human beings 
Anger
Fear
Disgust
Joy
Sadness
Surprise

Graphical representation of the circumplex model of affect: 

Findings:
Speaker's pitch and spech energy tends to increase with increasing positive emotion states

Emotion expressions or perceptions are in general heterogeneous accross individuals, which can be affected by a wide array of factors ranging from culture background, speaker's age and gender, to speaker's health conditions. 


Terms: 
Speaker pitch: Fundamental frecuency of speech
Z-normalisation
i-vector normalization
Speaker-dependent systems
Spectral features:  Spectral features indicating the distribution of the spectral energy across the range of frequency of speech were shown to be effective in distinguishing between emotion categories 
Prosodic features: pitch, jitter and shimmer, reflecting the auditory quality of sound have been shown to be indicative of emotional state. Formants and voice quality are consideren prosodic feature as well.
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs): Based on the properties of the human auditory system
Linear predictive coefficients: Model the characteristic of the human vocal tract
Dimensionaly reduction: There are generally two approaches for dimensionality reduction: feature selection and feature transformation
In feature selection, the main objective is to find the feature subset that achieves the best possible system performance

On the other hand, feature transform techniques aim to find a suitable linear or nonlinear mapping from the original feature space to another space with reduced dimensionality while preserving as much relevant classification/regression information as possible

Universal Background Model: It is a large mixture of Gaussians that covers all speech
and in the context of speaker recognition, it is adapted to each speaker

Is a gaussian mixture Model whose parameters consist of :
1. K weights w_k
2. means mu_k
3. (diagonal) variances sigma_k

Which in speaker identification context are MAP adapted to each speaker's data

Vocabulary:
MAP: Maximum a posteriori

Viterbi algorithm: Dynamic programming algorithm for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states
In speech-to-text (speech recognition), the acoustic signal is treated as the observed sequence of events, 
and a string of text is considered to be "hidden cause" of the acoustic signal. The Viterbu algoritm
 finds the most likely string of text given the acoustic signal
